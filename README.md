# StatsML

StatsML is a machine learning and data processing library for Python. 
It was developed by myself in an attempt to further consolidate my machine learning
education and gain experience through implementation of many state-of-the-art
processes used today. The library is not wholly extensive and does not implement specific hardware-level 
optimizations, but does contain the majority of features common to most machine learning libraries. These 
features range from simple statistical methods, to data processing, to deep neural networks and much more.

Having taken some machine learning courses both online and at university, I was inspired to 
read further into the literature and investigate deeper into the field. I decided to build StatsML entirely
from scratch without the help of any external packages, aside from NumPy for performance and usability purposes.
The ensuing documentation details some of my experiences and findings throughout this process.

*Please note that this library was not built to rival any prominent machine learning frameworks. 
It was simply built as an exploratory and educational endeavour for myself in order to expand my knowledge of the field.*

## Getting Started

The following instructions will help you to get StatsML up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
I encourage you to give it a look, experiment with it and give me any feedback you have. 

*Please be aware that all command line documentation given will be specifically for the Linux system.*

### Prerequisites

You may choose to run the project either in your machine's local environment, or to specifically setup a [virtual
environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) and separately install all packages.


The packages found in *requirements.txt* will then need to be installed using the following command:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

### Installation

In order to create a local copy of the codebase you will need to navigate to your desired directory and run the following command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/GiovanniPasserello/StatsML.git
```

## Usage
