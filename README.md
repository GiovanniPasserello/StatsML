# StatsML

StatsML is a machine learning and data processing library for Python. It was developed by myself in an attempt to further consolidate my machine learning education and gain experience through implementation of state-of-the-art processes. The library is not wholly extensive and does not implement specific hardware-level optimizations, but does contain the majority of features common to many machine learning libraries. These features range from simple statistical methods, to neural networks, to data processing, and much more.

*This library was not built to rival any prominent machine learning frameworks, it is simply an exploratory and educational endeavour for myself in order to expand my knowledge of the field.*

## Getting Started

The following instructions will help you to get StatsML up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
I encourage you to give it a look, experiment with it and give me any feedback you have. 

*Please be aware that all command line documentation given will be specifically for the Linux system.*

### Prerequisites

You may choose to run the project either in your machine's local environment, or to specifically setup a [virtual
environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) and separately install all packages.


The packages found in *requirements.txt* will then need to be installed using the following command:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

### Installation

In order to create a local copy of the codebase you will need to navigate to your desired directory and run the following command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/GiovanniPasserello/StatsML.git
```

## Usage

Discussion on purpose of each package and how to use it...

### Testing

## Performance

Discussion on various performance metrics of the library... 

Link to project repository that uses StatsML...

## Technologies

StatsML is built entirely from scratch without the help of external packages, aside from NumPy and Pandas for performance and data handling purposes.
